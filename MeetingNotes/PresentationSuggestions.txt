Title: "(Status of the) Measurement of the Charged Current Zero Pion cros section at the NOvA Near Detector"
Title slide: Put date, event name, event location. Name: SFS and MW on behalf of the Near Detector Physics group 

Intro: 
 - NuMI enegry spectrum, overlaped with theoretical xsection measurements, to justify the relevance of measuring this in NOvA
 - Why only ND?
 
 Analysis overview
 - Signal definition: E.g. Ntracks, nprongs, PionKE > 350 MeV
 - Maybe add some quick jargon defintion (e.g. track, prongs if utside NOvA)
 - Statisitics: POT, # events
 - Signal, Background, Efficiency, Purity flow in table (but prepare a graph too, like Ozgur's)
 - Event display? But choose a VERY NICE ONE. Or put two, one very clear and one more challenging
 


BDT or CVN or this ethereal stuff description:
- Model dependency: Be VERY Careful about claiming this... 
- MOST geometric quantities (e.g. lengths) are VERY Model dependent. What about angles???
- Describe a little the variables used. Use a graph or so.
- Have diagnostics of the CVN or BDT at the backup, to reassure people that we are not doing crazy things. 
  - Consult with experts, be careful not to expose to a whrilpool of questions.
